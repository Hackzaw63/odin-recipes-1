    <p><h2>Ingredients</h2></p>
<!--Start of list practice and page organization-->    
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>2 lbs extra lean ground beef</li>
            <li>1/2 onion (diced)</li>
            <li>1 green pepper (small diced)</li>
            <li>4 garlic cloves (minced)</li>
            <li>1 1/4 cup ketchup</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons worcestershire sauce</li>
            <li>3 tablespoon brown sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon dijon mustard</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon paprika</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
            <li>fresh ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>8 hamburger buns for serving</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p><h2>Let's Get Cooking</h2></p>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>Add ground beef and onions to a large skillet set over medium high heat and cook until beef is browned.</li>
            <li>Add all remaining ingedients (except for the buns!) and cook for 20-25 minutes, or until beef is crumbly and liquid has formed a thick sauce.</li>
            <li>Serve on a toasted bun</li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    <p><h3>NOTES (Always have to have notes ;)</h3></p>
    <p>The longer the mixture cooks, the thicker it will get. You want the sloppiest of joes to be thick enough to
        stand up on a wooden spoon so they don't ooze out of the hamburger bun.
