    <p><h3>Now here comes the fun part of making all of this delicious food! The Cooking!</h3></p>
    <p><h2>Let's Get Cooking</h2></p>
    <p><h3>Ragù Bologones (meat sauce)</h3></p>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li><h4>Preheat oven to 225°. Mix 2 lbs of ground pork and 1 lb ground beef chuck (20% fat) with your hands in a large bowl; season generously with kosher salt and freshly
                ground black pepper, then mix again. Form into 18 large meatballs.</h4></li>
            <li><h4>Warm 2 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oul in a large Dutch oven or other heavy pot over medium-high heat, Working in 2 batches, cook meatballs,
                turning occasionally and reducing heeat if bottom of pot looks in danger of scorching, unit browned all over, about 6 minutes per batch.
                Transfer to a rimmed baking sheet as they're done.</h4></li>
            <li><h4>Reduce heat to medium. Add 2 oz pancetta, to pot and cook, stirring often, until lightly browned and beginning to crisp, about 5 minutes.
                Add 1 medium onion, 1 celery stalk, 1 medium carrot, amd 6 cloves of garlic. Stirring occasionally until vegetables are sofetened 6-8 minutes. 
                Add 2 Tbsp tomato paste and cook, stirring constantly untill paste is darkened in color, about 2 minutes</h4></li>
            <li><h4>Add ¾ cup dry white wine and cook, stirring occasionally, until almost completely evaporated, about 5 minutes. Add one 28-oz. can whole peeled tomatoes, 
                crushing with your hands, and increase heat to medium-high. Cook, stirring occasionally, until liquid is jammy and reduced by about half, 8–10 minutes. 
                Add 1 cup low-sodium chicken broth and 1 cup whole milk, then return meatballs to pot. Bring to a simmer. Cover pot partially with a lid, transfer to oven, and cook, 
                checking every hour or so to ensure liquid is at a low simmer and adjusting oven temperature as needed, until meatballs are falling-apart tender, 3–4 hours.</h4></li>
            <li><h4>Using a potato masher, break meatballs apart and incorporate into liquid (you should have about 8 cups ragù; transfer pot to stovetop and simmer gently to reduce if needed). 
                Taste and season with more salt and black pepper if needed.</h4></li>
            <h4>Do Ahead: Ragu can be made 4 days ahead. Let cool; cover and chill, or freeze up to 3 months</h4>

            <li><h4>Gradually whisk in 6 cups whole milk. Bring to a simmer and cook, whisking often, until mixture is thickened and coats the back of a spoon, 8–10 minutes.</h4></li>
